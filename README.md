    - Running Application:

      Run the main class from Intellij

      or
       ```bash 
       mvn spring-boot:run 
       ``` 
2. Starting Angular Application (For Dashboard)
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

Now, Application is running at the default port 4200. Dashboard URL: ```localhost:4200```

## Access the API endpoints:

Once the application is running locally, you can access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
Verify API functionality:

Use the endpoints mentioned in the Endpoints section to verify functionality and interaction with WordPress APIs and
Gemini.
